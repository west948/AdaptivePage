				<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone

I tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the Sandman he comes

				Exit, light
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland</p>

				<p>Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White

Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite

				Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland</p>

				<p>Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Pray the Lord my soul to take

Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland

We're off to Never—, Neverland
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
Take my hand
We're off to Never—, Neverland
We're off to Never—, Neverland
We're off to Never—, Neverland
We're off to Never—, Neverland</p>
		<h2>About song</h2>
<p class="about">The original lyrics of this song were about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The line "Off to Never—, Neverland" originally was "Disrupt the perfect family", but the band's producer Bob Rock convinced James Hetfield to change it to make the song more accessible and meaningful.</p>	
<p class="about">Neverland is the name of the magical world where Peter Pan, the main character of the same-titled story, lives.</p>
<p class="about">With this song the band moved away from their previous complex sound to shorter songs. Drummer Lars Ulrich told Uncut in 2007, "The 10-minute, 12-tempo-changes side of Metallica had run its course. We wanted to streamline and simplify things."</p>
<p class="about">When the USA invaded Irag in 2003, this song was used to break the will of some prisoners during interrogations. Lars Ulrich commented on this, "If there are people that are dumb enough to use Metallica to interrogate prisoners, you're forgetting about all the music that's to the left of us. I can name, you know, 30 Norwegian death metal bands that would make Metallica sound like Simon & Garfunkel".</p>
<p class="about">"Enter Sandman" was certified platinum and it has the most radio play of all of Metallica's songs.</p>
